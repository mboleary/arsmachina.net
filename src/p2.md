title: Project 2 - Why aren't we all using free Software?
summary: Why aren't we all using Free and Open Source Software? Early Computers back in the 1950s to the 1970s often had the source code distributed with their programs, so why is it that we cannot continue this tradition? There certainly is a profound movement back into using free and open source software, which is getting better by the day, backed by an active software developer community.

# Project Information

This was the second project in my MART380 class.

## Motivation

I made this to show people that using Free and Open Source Software isn't so bad, and that I believe that it is the way of the future. 

I showed people using UNIX and Linux Systems in the video in both a personal and academic setting. I also included historical archived footage of some early IBM Mainframes  to show how far we have come today, and also some footage from a Linux-fest to show that there is a vibrant hacker (good type of hacking where people tinker with their devices) community full of users.

## How I made this

Like all of my other projects, I made this using completely Open Source Software. I found archived footage on Archive.org, and took some Creative-commons liscensed arrangements of Stallman's Free Software Song and mixed them together to make my project.
