I am Brady Oâ€™Leary. 

I write computer software, and have a proficiency in multiple programming languages. I also am a musician, whereas I played in the Carolina Band for 4 years, and write small compositions in the Linux MultiMedia Studio. My interests are largely in Computers and Music, as well as combining the two.

Eventually, this will become my personal website to show off not only my personal projects, but also will feature a blog, and a collection of links to other various websites around the internet.
