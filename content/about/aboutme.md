## Who am I?

My name is Brady O'Leary. I am a software engineer that currently specializes in full-stack web application development. In my off-time, you can find me listening to, writing, or playing music. I played the clarinet in a collegiate marching band for all 4 years while attending the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu) (Go Gamecocks!), and I write music using an open-source DAW called [LMMS](https://lmms.io).
