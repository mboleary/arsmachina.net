# Written Code

Since I'm a professional software developer, I write a lot of code for various professional and personal projects

## Github

Of the code that I upload, I put it on Github mainly.

I do have an older Github account that I used mainly when I was a student at the University of South Carolina.

## Gitlab

I don't often post things to Gitlab, but it's where I host this website from.
