# Hello World

This is a test of a section styling and posts

# Is the Space Pope reptilian!?

There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

Shut up and get to the point! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. __But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns.__ *Also he got a race car.* Is any of this getting through to you?

## You know, I was God once.

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? No! The cat shelter's on to me. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

1. No. We're on the top.
2. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
3. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

### Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! File not found. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Why would I want to know that?

* The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
* But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.
* Look, last night was a mistake.

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Why would I want to know that?

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? It's a T. It goes "tuh". I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.

And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

Is that a cooking show? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can.

You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Fatal. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory.

Shinier than yours, meatbag. Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Moving along… Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!

How much did you make me? Yeah, lots of people did. Take me to your leader! Tell them I hate them. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Really?! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Daylight and everything. Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. Kif might! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! No! Don't jump! Ow, my spirit!

Tell them I hate them. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
