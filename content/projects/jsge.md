The Javascript Game Engine (JSGE) is a modular game engine that I've been working on since [April 2020](https://github.com/mboleary/JsGameEngine/commit/1ed2e7b541b6f7930c7e059c76468eef48b6dc16), and was my pandemic project. While the initial goal was for me to learn the Web APIs better, it evolved into a series of libraries that I can integrate into other projects, and also an engine that can easily be used in a variety of ways and integrated with other 3rd party libraries.
