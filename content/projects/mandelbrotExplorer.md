# Mandelbrot Explorer

This was a testing project for me to learn how the canvas works in Javascript, as well as how I can color the Mandelbrot set. This was written without the use of a Javascript Framework.

There are additional Images in the repo linked above.

## Motivation

I built this demo as a way to learn Javascript, and how to specifically use the Canvas to draw things.

## How to run this locally

Go to the repository above, and clone or download the code locally. In there, use `python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1` in a console, and then open a web browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`.
