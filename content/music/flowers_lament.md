This soundtrack was developed for a game I helped create during my first semester of college as a freshman at USC in 2015. The game concept was a little unusual given that we were given 4 randomly-selected words to develop a game concept from. I don't remember what those words were now, but the game centered around a man whose wife was dying of cancer but he had an addiction to playing videogames, and so it followed the journey of his struggle to balance both of those needs in his life.

Most of the music was actually composed using Apple GarageBand, except for the first track which was composed using LMMS.

## About the game

I was a part of a student organization called the Carolina Gamers' Club (CGC), which was dedicated to playing and developing games. That semester, we were divided into several groups and given the task of creating a game based on some randomly picked words.

~~While I don't recall all of the words, I know some of them were~~ I found them, see link below. The words were:
- wife
- cancer
- disaster
- trainer


I don't have a copy of the game on-hand as this was developed a long time ago.
