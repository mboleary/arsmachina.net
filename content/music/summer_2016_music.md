This is a collection of music I wrote during the summer of 2016 when I was home after completing my freshman year in college at USC. I wrote these using LMMS, and was also experimenting with a VST Instrument that emulated the sound of the NES, so some of these would likely fall into the "fakebit" genre of electronic music.

### [Looking to the Future](https://soundcloud.com/nesdood007/looking-to-the-future?in=nesdood007/sets/summers-worth-of-music)

This track was inspired by a puzzle game that a friend of mine had created while I was at USC. I envisioned a more pure and clean electronic sound as the backdrop for that game.
