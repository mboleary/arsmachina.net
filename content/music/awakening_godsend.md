This is a track that I wrote during the first semester of my Sophomore year at USC. This track was made using LMMS and primarily the [ZynAddSubFX software synthesizer](https://zynaddsubfx.sourceforge.io/). Interestingly enough, it made its way into a Soundcloud playlist demoing the synthesizer, so it's the most-played track on my profile.
