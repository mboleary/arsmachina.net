This soundtrack was composed in the fall of 2016 for a 2d platformer game that was never really developed. At the time, I was involved in the Carolina Gamers Club at USC, a student organization dedicated to playing and developing games. That particular semester, we were divided into teams and given the task of creating a 2D platformer game in the style of Mega Man. The concept our team came up with involved 4 worlds of 3 levels each inspired by [Astrological signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrological_sign), I believe. The game was never really developed beyond a concept, so this is all that's really left of it. I have other tracks not included in this album that are less complete, so I haven't included it in the Soundcloud release but I may elsewhere if I find time to do so.

This is one of the earlier soundtracks where I started experimenting with [thematic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_transformation), using a common theme that's altered for several tracks.
