A few years ago, KDE was looking for some ringtones for their Plasma Mobile operating system as well as keyboard sounds and so they opened a contest. I happened to have a number of short pieces that I wrote many years prior in college and never really published anywhere that I thought would be cool to clean up, loop, and submit. I chose 13 compositions from my collection, mostly electronic due to my setup, and categorized most as ringtones and one as an alarm, though I don't really make much of a distinction between those categories as both kinds of sounds serve a similar purpose. I don't remember how many submissions the contest got in total, but there was a good variety of submissions provided by many people, which I'm sure was seen as a success by the organizers. After the submission window closed and judging took place, I was delighted to find out that they had declared me the winner and included 3 of my submissions in their final collection.

## About the shorts

I have a huge collection of shorts I've written over the years and may release when I find time at some point in the future. Most of the ones I added were written while I was in college and was experimenting with LMMS, an Open Source DAW.
