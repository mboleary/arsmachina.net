Back in 2017, I witnessed the [solar eclipse as it passed over Columbia, SC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_21,_2017) on the band practice field at the University of South Carolina. It was easily one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Around the same time, I played through the game Fez again, and felt inspired to make a game that scratched that same itch of a platformer that harnessed a higher dimension to change the gameplay area, since the sequel to the game was infamously cancelled. I didn't have a strong gameplay concept or prototype of how the game would actually work, but I did have some ideas for how I wanted the soundtrack to sound, and put together this concept album from that.

## Thematic Music

The soundtrack grew from a singular theme that I wrote early on in its development and evolved into several other pieces that also use that theme.
