# Music

I make music using the Linux Multi-Media Studio [LMMS](https://lmms.io). Even though the software certainly has its pitfalls, I think that limitations inspire creativity, and also it's free and I've built up a good collection of instrument presets to use.

I post some of my music online in a few places.

## Soundcloud

I promise, I'm not a shitty soundcloud rapper. I update this from time to time.

## Youtube

I don't post videos very often anymore, but I might at some point in the future.
