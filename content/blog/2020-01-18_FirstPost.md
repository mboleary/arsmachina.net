# Hello World

This is the first post in my new personal blog. Expect to see a lot of changes as the website design improves and matures. I still have a lot of things to implement, such as the rest of the CSS framework, and the rest of the Website layout.

This website is still a __work in progress__. Things will be a mess at first.
